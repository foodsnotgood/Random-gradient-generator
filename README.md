I found this excercise on dev.to in a article by Miguel Nunez "15 Beginner JavaScript Projects to improve your front-end skills" and found this one specifically interesting
because I was just getting into DOM manipulation.

Here I used a simple for loop to generate a random hex code which then gets used to change the background of the page.
Feel free to play around with it  and let me know if you have any suggestions.
